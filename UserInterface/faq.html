            <p>Since 1969, Easyquotes has been providing quality insurance to Canadians. From car insurance to homeowners insurance, we have solutions to suit your unique needs. You're In Good Hands With Rate Insurance.</p>

            <p>On June 1, 2016, the accident benefits included in Ontario standard auto insurance policies changed. The Ontario government introduced these changes to make premiums more affordable, offer greater choice for consumers and improve the overall
                system. While in some circumstances the reforms affect the monetary amount of accident benefits that an individual may receive for injuries sustained in a collision, they do not affect access to the treatments and benefits needed to recover.</p>

            <h3>What types of insurance does Easyquotes Insurance offer?</h3>
            <p>Easyquotes Insurance is Canada’s largest personal and business insurance company. We offer auto, home insurance through a network of brokers across Canada.</p>

            <h3>How can we help you today?</h3>
            <p>At Easyquotes, our main goals are to give you the information you need to put you at the center of every decision, and to give you advice to help protect what’s important to you. With hundreds of local experts, you can rely on our trusted
                advice and all the support you deserve.</p>

            <h3>How long do I have access?</h3>
            <p>You have lifetime access to the plan. In other words, it never expires. Months, even years from now you can re-use the plan without paying again.</p>

            <h3>How does the refund policy works?</h3>
            <p>If you're unhappy for any reason, email us within 30 days of purchasing on the web, and we will give you a full refund. No strings attached.</p>

            <h3>What can I do to make sure that I have enough insurance?</h3>
            <p>Your insurance broker will assess your needs based on the details you provide about your home or vehicle. In case of home insurance, a complete inventory of your belongings will help you get the right coverage and make it easier to file a
                claim.
            </p>

            <h3>Is the rate given to me accurate? </h3>
            <p>We use the same rating software as the majority of insurance brokers in Canada (i.e., Compu- Quote Rating Services). When you call a broker, they take your details and do quotes with the companies they are contracted with, usually 3 or 4 different
                companies, and then give you a rate from those companies. Easyquotes@gmail.com, however, check rates from more than 30 of the top insurance companies in Canada, giving consumers a more comprehensive view of the universe of insurance rates
                to help ensure they are quoted the lowest rate available. Rates are based on the information provided, and we update regularly to ensure our accuracy. Most rate discrepancies occur due to wrong information inputted. For example, many car
                models are similarly-named; Nissan Altima vs. Nissan Altima SE. This discrepancy can lead to a considerable difference in rates.</p>

                <p>If you are planning to move out of your home temporarily while your renovation project is completed, this can impact your existing insurance policy. This is especially true if you will be out of your home for 30 days or longer. You may
                    need to change your home’s status to “under construction” or obtain a home vacancy permit in order to have coverage for perils like vandalism or theft while your home is unoccupied.

                <summary class="blogHeading">Will my policy protect me if a contractor, subcontractor or construction worker is hurt on my property while working on my home remodel?</summary>
                <p>The simplest answer to this complicated question is often “no.” You need to verify that your contractor carries a general liability insurance policy, and also that they are covered by workers compensation. If you do the work yourself,
                    obviously the risk of a contractor damaging your home or being injured is not a factor. However, this doesn’t change your need to notify your insurer about remodel plans. DIY renovations are still home renovations.
