                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Your insurance broker will assess your needs based on the details you provide about your home 
                            or vehicle. In case of home insurance, a complete inventory of your belongings will help you get
                            the right coverage and make it easier to file a claim.

            <button class="accordion">Is the rate given to me accurate?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>We use the same rating software as the majority of insurance brokers in Canada (i.e., Compu-
                            Quote Rating Services). When you call a broker, they take your details and do quotes with the 
                            companies they are contracted with, usually 3 or 4 different companies, and then give you a rate
                            from those companies. Easyquotes@gmail.com, however, check rates from more than 30 of the top 
                            insurance companies in Canada, giving consumers a more comprehensive view of the universe of 
                            insurance rates to help ensure they are quoted the lowest rate available. Rates are based on the 
                            information provided, and we update regularly to ensure our accuracy. Most rate discrepancies occur
                            due to wrong information inputted. For example, many car models are similarly-named; Nissan Altima 
                            vs. Nissan Altima SE. This discrepancy can lead to a considerable difference in rates.

            <button class="accordion">Can I get fire insurance through Easyquotes?</button>
                <div class="panel"> 
                    <p>EasyQuotes covers you for loss or damage caused by a fire whether you’re a homeowner, condo owner, landlord or tenant. Proof of fire insurance is often requested by a mortgagee or landlord – our policies include fire insurance along with many other coverages. You can provide a copy of your home insurance policy for this request.

            <button class="accordion">What's the difference between Actual Replacemnet Cost and Actual Cash Value?</button>
                <div class="panel"> 
                    <p>Actual Replacement Cost. If you have a claim and decide to repair or replace your lost or damaged property, we’ll cover this no matter how much it costs and without any deduction for depreciation (wear and tear from its use). 
                    Actual Cash Value. If you have a claim and decide not to repair or replace your lost or damaged property, we can pay you cash for the cost of the item, taking into consideration its condition at the time of loss. For example, if you had a bicycle that was 10 years old, we’d price it based on its age and used condition. The value of the item is reduced because of normal wear and tear over time.

                        <br>Your vehicle: The information we get about your vehicle and your claims/driving history mainly comes from the Insurance Bureau of Canada and the Ministry of Transportation for your province (in Quebec, we also get information from the Groupement des assureurs automobiles).

                    <p>If you are planning to move out of your home temporarily while your renovation project is completed, this can impact your existing insurance policy. This is especially true if you will be out of your home for 30 days or longer. You may
                        need to change your home’s status to “under construction” or obtain a home vacancy permit in order to have coverage for perils like vandalism or theft while your home is unoccupied.

                <summary class="blogHeading">Will my policy protect me if a contractor, subcontractor or construction worker is hurt on my property while working on my home remodel?</summary>
                <p>The simplest answer to this complicated question is often “no.” You need to verify that your contractor carries a general liability insurance policy, and also that they are covered by workers compensation. If you do the work yourself,
                        obviously the risk of a contractor damaging your home or being injured is not a factor. However, this doesn’t change your need to notify your insurer about remodel plans. DIY renovations are still home renovations.
