            <p>Since 1969, Evernote has been providing quality insurance to Canadians. From car insurance to
                        homeowners insurance, we have solutions to suit your unique needs. 
                        You're In Good Hands With Rate Insurance.

            <p>On June 1, 2016, the accident benefits included in Ontario standard auto insurance policies changed.
                   The Ontario government introduced these changes to make premiums more affordable, offer greater
                   choice for consumers and improve the overall system. While in some circumstances the reforms affect
                   the monetary amount of accident benefits that an individual may receive for injuries sustained in a
                   collision, they do not affect access to the treatments and benefits needed to recover.</p>
                       
            <h3>What types of insurance does Evernote Insurance offer?</h3>
            <p>Evernote Insurance is Canada’s largest personal and business insurance company. 
                       We offer auto, home insurance through a network of brokers across Canada.</p>
                   
            <h3>How can we help you today?</h3> 
            <p>At Evernote, our main goals are to give you the information you need to put you at the center of
                    every decision, and to give you advice to help protect what’s important to you. With hundreds
                     of local experts, you can rely on our trusted advice and all the support you deserve.</p>
           
            <h3>How long do I have access?</h3>
            <p>You have lifetime access to the plan. In other words, it never expires. Months, even years
                      from now you can re-use the plan without paying again.</p>
           
            <h3>How does the refund policy works?</h3>
            <p>If you're unhappy for any reason, email us within 30 days of purchasing on the web, and we
                       will give you a full refund. No strings attached.</p>
           
            <h3>What can I do to make sure that I have enough insurance?</h3>
            <p>Your insurance broker will assess your needs based on the details you provide about your home 
                   or vehicle. In case of home insurance, a complete inventory of your belongings will help you get
                    the right coverage and make it easier to file a claim.</p>

            <h3>Is the rate given to me accurate? </h3>
            <p>We use the same rating software as the majority of insurance brokers in Canada (i.e., Compu-
                    Quote Rating Services). When you call a broker, they take your details and do quotes with the 
                    companies they are contracted with, usually 3 or 4 different companies, and then give you a rate
                    from those companies. InsuranceEvernote.ca, however, check rates from more than 30 of the top 
                    insurance companies in Canada, giving consumers a more comprehensive view of the universe of 
                    insurance rates to help ensure they are quoted the lowest rate available. Rates are based on the 
                    information provided, and we update regularly to ensure our accuracy. Most rate discrepancies occur
                    due to wrong information inputted. For example, many car models are similarly-named; Nissan Altima 
                    vs. Nissan Altima SE. This discrepancy can lead to a considerable difference in rates.</p>
