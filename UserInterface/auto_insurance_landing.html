                    <p class="blogHeading">Will my current homeowners insurance policy provide sufficient coverage while my home is being remodeled?</p>
                    <p>If you are planning to move out of your home temporarily while your renovation project is completed, this can impact your existing insurance policy.
                     This is especially true if you will be out of your home for 30 days or longer. You may need to change your home’s status to “under construction” or
                     obtain a home vacancy permit in order to have coverage for perils like vandalism or theft while your home is unoccupied.</p>

                 <p class="blogHeading">Will my policy protect me if a contractor, subcontractor or construction worker is hurt on my property while working on my home remodel?</p>
                 <p>The simplest answer to this complicated question is often “no.” You need to verify that your contractor carries a general liability insurance policy, and also that they are covered by workers compensation.
                     If you do the work yourself, obviously the risk of a contractor damaging your home or being injured is not a factor. 
                     However, this doesn’t change your need to notify your insurer about remodel plans. DIY renovations are still home renovations.</p>
