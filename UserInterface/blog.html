                <h2>What does your home insurance policy cover,exacly?</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>Home insurance is not regulated like auto insurance. In fact, unless you have a mortgage or rental agreement, you are not obligated to even have it.</p>
                    <p>Policies can differ widely and may not fully protect you. Sometimes you need to pay a bit more to add a rider to the policy for your valuables, or to help protect against different risks.</p>
                    <p>Here are two scenarios that may not be covered under your current home insurance policy.</p>

Coverage may only be provided for a certain number of
                                days. If your house will be empty for longer than the minimum you’ll likely be required to have someone visit your home on a regular basis – generally every three to seven days depending on your policy.</span>

                                for damage caused by water coming into your property from a sewer, septic system or sump pump Overland flooding, on the other hand, is most likely not included in your basic home insurance policy. This is caused from the
                                sudden accumulation of water from heavy rains, spring run-off, or overflow from lakes and rivers.</span>

                                covered if you have cracks in your foundation, loose window casements, or a leaky dishwasher that allow water to seep through. Insurers will take into account depreciation of your roof and garden
                                shed, and even the condition of the trees in your yard. Personal property is almost always covered for replacement cost at today’s prices. Actual cash value will only pay today’s value for the item, prorated for age, use
                                and condition. However, you must actually replace the items and provide receipts. The insurance company won’t just hand you a cheque.</span><a>Show More</a></p>

That fear trumped any of the other fears listed in the survey. Add to that
                            the fact that 39% are nervous about their rates going up after a claim and you’re left with a lot of people worrying about the cost of their insurance. Knowing what you need in an insurance policy by having an open and frank
                            discussion with your broker can help to make sure that you have enough information to compare rates and competing offers, and help to alleviate some of those concerns.</span>

                            Mom and Dad for their insight rather than someone with insurance expertise. That’s great if your parents have good information but many of them aren’t nearly as well informed about options as a broker would be. Consider family
                            input but make sure you also seek out information from someone who does this for a living</span>

                <h2>Three things you can do to help keep your auto insurance costs down</h2>
                <article>

                    <p>When it comes to insurance, Canadians have an opinion. In a recent survey conducted by Leger for EQ insurance, Canadians weighed in on their behaviours behind the wheel. The problem is that many of those behaviours weren’t that positive.
                        “Many Canadians don’t even realize that not only is their behaviour distracting, but that it also has an impact on their insurance costs,” says Kathy Buckworth, Chief Family Advisor for EQ Financial services. “It often leads to
                        tickets or traffic violations that can end up impacting a driver’s record for an extended period of time. No matter how you spin it, the cost just isn’t worth it.”</p>
                    <p>The good news is that there are things you can do to help keep insurance costs down. Here are three to get you started:</p>
                    <img class="image2" src="images/blogpost_car.jpg" alt="car image">

                            <h4>Stop Talking on the Phone</h4>
                            <p class="showmore">The Leger survey found that 37 per cent of respondents admit to talking on a cellphone while driving.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> A whopping 96 per cent claim to have witnessed this behaviour in others. Those numbers suggest that despite laws against
                                this behaviour in many provinces, people are STILL having conversations on the phone while in the car. This behaviour is dangerous and if you get a ticket or cause an accident while doing so, you risk increased insurance
                                costs. Bottom line - don’t do it.</span><a>Show More</a></p>

                            <p class="showmore">The survey also found that 22 per cent of respondents admit to texting while driving. And 85 per cent say they have witnessed others doing it.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> Texting while driving seems to be a prevalent distractive driving behaviour. Not
                                only are you taking your eyes off the road but your hands as well. The repercussions for sending that text can be huge. And in retrospect it’s unlikely that “LOL” or “TTYL” will be worth it if it leads to an accident.

                        <li>
                            <h4>Get Professional Advice</h4>
                            <p class="showmore">The survey found that more than half of respondents seek advice from family, friends or coworkers when researching insurance options, <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">while 35 per cent will do their own research. That’s a lot of people asking for important
                                advice from people who may not have the right information. Interestingly, only 30 per cent of survey respondents say that they will use an insurance broker to find the best coverage to fit their needs. Young Canadians are
                                especially dependent on family when making insurance decisions: 59 per cent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 said that they would turn to their parents for advice. Insurance is important and while anecdotal
                                information is helpful, getting professional advice can make a huge difference in making sure you are properly covered.</span>
