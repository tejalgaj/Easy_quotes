                            <p>
                                There are plenty of things you can do to help secure your home while you’re away (alarm system, setting a timer for lights, putting a hold on your mail so it doesn’t pile up), but accidents do happen sometimes. Before you travel, consider getting your
                                home covered with a comprehensive home insurance (necessary whether you own or rent), to have insurance coverage for your house if it’s affected by water damage, fire or any other number of accidents. Already in vacay mode
                                and have no time to research the best rate available for you? No worries– RA® insurance brokers actually do the comparison shopping for you, reaching out to up to 7 companies to ensure you’re getting the best rate they
                                can find for you (plus you can earn EQ Optimum points by using a EQ Financial® Mastercard® for your insurance payments, so… #winning!).

                <h2>What does your home insurance policy cover,exacly?</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>Home insurance is not regulated like auto insurance. In fact, unless you have a mortgage or rental agreement, you are not obligated to even have it.</p>
                    <p>Policies can differ widely and may not fully protect you. Sometimes you need to pay a bit more to add a rider to the policy for your valuables, or to help protect against different risks.</p>
                    <p>Here are two scenarios that may not be covered under your current home insurance policy.</p>
                    <img class="image2" src="images/blogpost_What_Your_Insurance_Covers.jpg" alt="Home Insurance Covers">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Leaving for an extended period of time</h4>
                            <p>You may not be covered while you are away from home for an extended period. That’s because an unoccupied home is at greater risk of damage and susceptible to break-ins.
                            </p>
                            <p>Coverage may only be provided for a certain number of days. If your house will be empty for longer than the minimum you’ll likely be required to have someone visit your home on a regular basis – generally every three to seven
                                days depending on your policy.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Different types of water coverage</h4>
                            <p>Not all water damage is created equal. Basic water coverage helps provide coverage due to damage caused by a burst pipe, for example.</p>
                            <p>Sewer back-up coverage may or may not be included in your basic policy. This coverage is for damage caused by water coming into your property from a sewer, septic system or sump pump
                            </p>
                            <p>Overland flooding, on the other hand, is most likely not included in your basic home insurance policy. This is caused from the sudden accumulation of water from heavy rains, spring run-off, or overflow from lakes and rivers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Your home’s market value</h4>
                            <p>Home insurance only covers the actual cost to repair or replace your home as it was before the loss. Insurance companies will look at the overall maintenance of your home. You need to keep up with repairs. You are not usually
                                covered if you have cracks in your foundation, loose window casements, or a leaky dishwasher that allow water to seep through.
                            </p>
                            <p>Insurers will take into account depreciation of your roof and garden shed, and even the condition of the trees in your yard.</p>
                            <p>Personal property is almost always covered for replacement cost at today’s prices. Actual cash value will only pay today’s value for the item, prorated for age, use and condition.
                            </p>
                            <p>However, you must actually replace the items and provide receipts. The insurance company won’t just hand you a cheque.</p>
                        </li>

                <h2>Three Questions you should ask before buying auto insurance</h2>
                <img class="image2" src="images/blogpost_keys.jpg" alt="Questions before taking auto insurance">
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Am I paying more than I need to?</h4>
                        <p>When asked whether they would rather pay more for insurance or risk not having enough coverage, 62% of Canadians said they were more concerned about cost. That fear trumped any of the other fears listed in the survey. Add to that
                            the fact that 39% are nervous about their rates going up after a claim and you’re left with a lot of people worrying about the cost of their insurance. Knowing what you need in an insurance policy by having an open and frank
                            discussion with your broker can help to make sure that you have enough information to compare rates and competing offers, and help to alleviate some of those concerns.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Am I asking the right person?
                        </h4>
                        <p>Mom and Dad are great for anecdotal advice, but your specific needs are going to be best addressed by a professional. Despite this, the survey found that most of those surveyed –(59% of young Canadians age 18-34)–) are still asking
                            Mom and Dad for their insight rather than someone with insurance expertise. That’s great if your parents have good information but many of them aren’t nearly as well informed about options as a broker would be. Consider family
                            input but make sure you also seek out information from someone who does this for a living
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Have I checked with enough different insurers?</h4>
                        <p>That recommendation from Mom and Dad shouldn’t mean that you don’t compare your options. The survey found that 41% of respondents indicated that they generally look at two or three quotes. More than one third said they do their
                            own research into home and auto insurance, although approximately three in ten will turn to an insurance broker or a family member for advice. That’s not enough. Offers can vary widely between brokers. At EQ insurance, brokers
                            compare up to 9 providers. Take advantage of the expertise that EQ insurance offers by seeking out the help and information you need and deserve.</p>
                        <p>About the Survey</p>
                        <p>The survey of 1,500 Canadians was conducted for EQ Financial Insurance Broker Inc. between July 25 and July 31, 2014 using Leger’s online panel LegerWeb. A probability sample of the same size would yield a margin of error of +/-
                            2.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20.</p>

                <h2>Three things you can do to help keep your auto insurance costs down</h2>
                <article>

                    <p>When it comes to insurance, Canadians have an opinion. In a recent survey conducted by Leger for EQ insurance, Canadians weighed in on their behaviours behind the wheel. The problem is that many of those behaviours weren’t that positive.
                        “Many Canadians don’t even realize that not only is their behaviour distracting, but that it also has an impact on their insurance costs,” says Kathy Buckworth, Chief Family Advisor for EQ Financial services. “It often leads to
                        tickets or traffic violations that can end up impacting a driver’s record for an extended period of time. No matter how you spin it, the cost just isn’t worth it.”</p>
                    <p>The good news is that there are things you can do to help keep insurance costs down. Here are three to get you started:</p>
                    <img class="image2" src="images/blogpost_car.jpg">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Stop Talking on the Phone</h4>
                            <p>The Leger survey found that 37 per cent of respondents admit to talking on a cellphone while driving. A whopping 96 per cent claim to have witnessed this behaviour in others. Those numbers suggest that despite laws against
                                this behaviour in many provinces, people are STILL having conversations on the phone while in the car. This behaviour is dangerous and if you get a ticket or cause an accident while doing so, you risk increased insurance
                                costs. Bottom line - don’t do it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>
                                Stop Texting while Driving
                            </h4>
                            <p>The survey also found that 22 per cent of respondents admit to texting while driving. And 85 per cent say they have witnessed others doing it. Texting while driving seems to be a prevalent distractive driving behaviour. Not
                                only are you taking your eyes off the road but your hands as well. The repercussions for sending that text can be huge. And in retrospect it’s unlikely that “LOL” or “TTYL” will be worth it if it leads to an accident.
                            </p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Get Professional Advice</h4>
                            <p>The survey found that more than half of respondents seek advice from family, friends or coworkers when researching insurance options, while 35 per cent will do their own research. That’s a lot of people asking for important
                                advice from people who may not have the right information. Interestingly, only 30 per cent of survey respondents say that they will use an insurance broker to find the best coverage to fit their needs. Young Canadians are
                                especially dependent on family when making insurance decisions: 59 per cent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 said that they would turn to their parents for advice. Insurance is important and while anecdotal
                                information is helpful, getting professional advice can make a huge difference in making sure you are properly covered.
